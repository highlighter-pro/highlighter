# Highlighter.pro 

This is a Chrome extension for highlighting text on webpages and (optionally) adding notes.

It's very lightweight and very fast. It makes maximum use of the browser's built-in capabilities and does not overload pages with its own scripts.

It does not transfer your highlights and notes to remote server, does not require permission to send/receive data to internet, and does not transfer any data to Internet.

* Notes to highlights can be written in [GitHub flavored](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) Markdown. It means you can format text, add notes, task lists, code blocks etc.

## How to save and restore backup

## Where it does not work 

Highlights may not be shown on web pages, where content is changing, like Facebook, X.com etc. 
Your highlights will be saved and shown in the browser's side panel for such pages, but highlights may not be shown on the page itself.

It does not work on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com) website.
