# Highlighter 

## Description 

This is a Chrome extension for highlighting text on webpages and (optionally) adding notes. 

## Why was it written?

We were looking for highlight extension for browser with open code. And there were none. 

It was designed to be simple and open sourced.

It does not transfer your highlights and notes to remote server, does not require permission to send/receive data to internet, and does not transfer any data to Internet, exempt for sync your theme choice in browser settings (but no third party Internet server)

The code is open sourced. 

This extension does not collect any user data. 

* Open code, see: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/highlighter-pro/highlighter) and [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/highlighter-pro/highlighter) 
* Your highlights and notes are saved locally with an option to save and restore a backup.
* You can use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) in notes. 

## Panel 

Chrome can not show different Side Panel content for different windows.
